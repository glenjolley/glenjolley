This is a tempoarary (see: probably permanent) portfolio of personal projects I've worked on. I usually use Azure DevOps repos for my code, but for the purposes of hosting some projects as a portfolio I thought github might be somewhat easier to navigate.

Some of these projects are old, most are incomplete, but they're what I do in my (very limited) spare time to keep myself in the loop and practice new things I learn, because if there's anything I love, it's learning new things.
